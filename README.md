#### The BACKEND part is well written :heart_eyes: but the FRONTEND of this project sucks in my opinion :joy:

#### It took me exact 20 hours to complete this project measured [here](https://wakatime.com); its too slow :cry: but for a 1st Full Stack MERN Stack I think its great

#### The time for this project must be not more than 6 hours as its not too complex & only has 1500 Lines Of Code

#### Anywayz my next projects will be much faster than this one :wink:
